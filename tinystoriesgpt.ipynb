The previous block size allowed the model to see an entire story in its context length since most stories were just about under 256 tokens so I thought this may help the model with knowing how to end a story that it started. However, I think the model learned to rely on having the full 256 tokens of context in order to make its predictions so when I gave it only one token of context, it was not able to generalize well enough to produce stories in the way that it was trained. Although this may not actually be true because the model trains on every time step of context so it trains on examples from varying context from 1 token to the full 256 tokens. In any case, below I am experimenting with a smaller block size and more resourceful model of double the size based on parameters.\n","    </li>\n","    <li>\n","        After training the larger model I have found that it isnt really any better (at least for the same number of training steps).
